The following key files are correctly formatted and intended to be loadable:

- **File:** UTC--2016-03-22T12-57-55.920751759Z--7ef5a6135f1fd6a02593eedc869c6d41d934aef8

  - **Address:** 0x289d485d9771714cce91d3393d764e1311907acc

- **File:** no-address (Missing address field, otherwise identical to "aaa")
- **File:** garbage (Contains random data)
- **File:** empty (No content)
- **File:** swapfile~ (Should be ignored)
- **File:** .hiddenfile (Should be ignored)
